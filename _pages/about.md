I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of California, San Diego. My research bridges American politics and International Relations, with a focus on the role of legislative institutions in foreign policymaking. Specifically, my current work examines how and why members of Congress engage in diplomacy and the implications of congressional diplomacy for American foreign policy.

My research is supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program, the 21st Century China Center, and the Center for American Politics. I hold an M.A. in Political Science from UC San Diego as well as a B.A. in Government & Politics and a B.S. in Information Systems from the University of Maryland.
